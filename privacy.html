<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 23, 2026</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes how German Lex Quest (“the App”) handles user information.
We respect your privacy. The App does not collect, store, or share personal information.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>The App does not collect, store, transmit, or share personal information.
The App does not:
* Require user accounts
* Collect names, email addresses, or contact information
* Collect location data
* Collect device identifiers
* Use third-party analytics services
* Use advertising SDKs
* Store data on external servers. All app usage and progress data is stored locally on your device only.
</p>

<p>We do not require users to create an account and we do not collect names, email addresses, or location data.</p>

<h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
<p>The App offers optional in-app purchases. All payments are processed securely by 
Apple through the App Store. We do not have access to your payment information.
For more information about how Apple handles data, please review Apple’s Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>Analytics</h2>
<p>If analytics services are used, they collect anonymous, aggregated usage data 
to help improve the App. This data does not identify individual users.</p>

<h2>Data storage</h2>
<p>Any learning progress, settings, or preferences are stored locally on your device using Apple’s system storage frameworks.
If you delete the App, this data is deleted with it.
We do not have access to this data.</p>

<h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>The App does not knowingly collect personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13.
Because no personal data is collected, there is no risk of personal data being shared or sold.</p>

<h2>Data Security</h2>
<p>Because we do not collect personal data, we do not store personal user information on our servers.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected 
by updating the “Last Updated” date at the top of this page.</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>
